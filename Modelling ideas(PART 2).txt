Determine factors influencing whether a program is likely to have a high number of volunteers
>can use race, participation based on population representation

Factors influencing whether a state is likely to have more or less diversity in volunteers
>population size, census breakdown for race in the state or region

Factors influencing whether a program is likely to have more or less diversity in volunteers
>state/region, number of volunteers, race breakdown of volunteers and relative to census

All lend themselves to Linear Regression/or Logistic Regression to include interaction effects
>>Can incorporate socioeconomic status since we have that data

We could make a logistic regression to see if a program is likely to have a high number of volunteers based on race, socioeconomic status, and maybe one other category

We could also see if minorities were more likely to work in certain programs or locations. 

Effect of being a senior citizen on volunteering. Effect of socioeconomic status on volunteering.
