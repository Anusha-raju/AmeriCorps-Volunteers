Determine factors influencing whether a program is likely to have a high number of volunteers
>can use race, participation based on population representation

Factors influencing whether a state is likely to have more or less diversity in volunteers
>population size, census breakdown for race in the state or region

Factors influencing whether a program is likely to have more or less diversity in volunteers
>state/region, number of volunteers, race breakdown of volunteers and relative to census

All lend themselves to Linear Regression/or Logistic Regression to include interaction effects
>>Can incorporate socioeconomic status since we have that data

Rachel

We could make a logistic regression to see if a program is likely to have a high number of volunteers based on race, socioeconomic status, and maybe one other category

We could also see if minorities were more likely to work in certain programs or locations. 

Effect of being a senior citizen on volunteering. Effect of socioeconomic status on volunteering.

-------
The idea about using regression (both linear and logistic) to access the likelyhood of having a high number of volunteers based on race, dem_group_population etc..., seems to end up giving us just a intercept only/null model rather than an regression equation since all these are categorical variable. Even the dem_group population count acts as a categorical variable, as the population census for a group remains the same in 2022.

New dataset proposal:

Capital Bikeshare data https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data
Single month (ie Oct-Nov 2024) has >725K observations... There are many months to choose from

EDA: 
Freq of Electric bike vs Classic bike rental
Avg duration of ride on E bike vs classic bike (will need to calculate duration from date time provided, probably need to disaggregate date and time into different columns)
Avg distance of ride on e bike vs classic bike (will need to calculate distance from lat/long provided
Freq of different users : Member vs Casual
Any neighborhoods more likely to be start/end (match lat/long to neighborhoods)

Correlations:
Time of day and type of member (People commuting vs tourists?)
Duration of ride and type of member
Type of bike and type of member
Location and type of member

Models:
Predict whether the user is a type of member based on above factors (Time of day, duration of ride, type of bike, Location rode to or from)
