    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction on AmeriCorps</h2>
        <p>
            AmeriCorps is a national service program in the United States, established in 1993, that encourages individuals to serve their communities through various initiatives. Members engage in projects that address pressing social issues such as education, health, public safety, and environmental sustainability. In return for their service, members may receive benefits like education awards, living stipends, and professional experience. Americorps also offers grants so that recipients can create service projects that suit the unique needs of their community.
        </p>
        <p>
            AmeriCorps programs are split into two categories: AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors. AmeriCorps core programs include National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), State and National, and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA). Public Health AmeriCorps falls under State and National. These core AmeriCorps programs typically recruit volunteers in, or recently graduated from, colleges and universities. Volunteers to these progrms serve in many ways, including on short deployments with FEMA or the US Forest Service, in all aspects of community support, or embedded in organizations working on sustainable change for poverty, climate change, or education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comprised of four core programs, AmeriCorps Seniors provides opportunities for for adults aged 55 and over to contribute their skills and experience to community service. AmeriCorps Seniors programs include Foster Grandparent Program (FGP), Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), and Senior Companion Program (SCP). AmeriCorps Seniors programs encourage seniors to engage in meaningful volunteer work that often supports younger generations or helps those in need.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to supporting local communities and the country at-large, work in AmeriCorps programs provide numerous benefits to the volunteers as well. For the younger volunteers, these include living allowance, money for college, loan deferment, professional development, and networking. For older volunteers, benefits include health and wellness, interaction in the community, self-improvement, learning new skills, a stipend, and insurance.
        </p>
        <p>
        Together, AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors play a crucial role in fostering civic engagement and addressing community needs across the country.

    <!-- Key Findings Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Racial groups with the highest participation are predominantly white, but with significant involvement of other racial groups.</li>
            <li>State-level participation shows that some states, like California, have more racially diverse volunteer pools compared to others.</li>
            <li>AmeriCorps Seniors has the largest number of volunteers in terms of Member Service Years (MSYs), particularly among older adults.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This analysis of AmeriCorps participant demographics reveals key insights into volunteer diversity across different racial groups. It shows that while white volunteers are the most prevalent group, non-white groups are also significantly represented, particularly in more diverse states like California.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, AmeriCorps Seniors programs demonstrate the substantial role older adults play in volunteerism, which challenges the notion that youth are the primary drivers of volunteer activities. This suggests the need for further exploration into volunteer engagement across different age groups.
