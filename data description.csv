dem_group,"Demographic Group: Allows users to select between the standard census race, ethnicity, sex, and SES (Mother's Level of Education) options. Race/Ethnicity Details In the list of races and ethnicities in the dashboard, ""Hispanic/Latino(a)"" is an ethnicity group, and therefore is not included in the race group measures “Racially Diverse (Non-White)” or “Two or More Races.”  The ""Racially Diverse (Non-White)"" option assesses whether non-white members and volunteers (regardless of ethnicity) are collectively over or under-represented. Socioeconomic Status Details AmeriCorps began collecting member socioeconomic status data in 2022. An informal literature review and a preliminary statistical analysis determined that mother’s highest level of education is an acceptable proxy for members’ relative socioeconomic statuses. The greater a member’s mother’s level of education, the more likely that person is to have a relatively high socioeconomic status. Data collection is pending for AmeriCorps Seniors volunteer socioeconomic status. Sex Details In 2021, AmeriCorps added a “non-binary” option to the sex selections for AmeriCorps members and a “Gender Fluid/Does Not Identify as Male or Female” option to the sex selections for AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers.  In the first full year for which we have results, approximately 1.6% of members and 0.6% of volunteers fell into these groups. These new groups are not included in the statistical analysis because the American Community Survey does not collect equivalent data at this time, so we have nothing to compare them against.Read more"
